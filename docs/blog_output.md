# Blog Output Module – CyberOpsDaily

This document outlines the planned structure and functionality for exporting `.md` articles generated by `generate_articles.py` to blogs, websites, or newsletters.

---

## 📌 Purpose

Enable seamless publication of cybersecurity articles, summaries, and reports written in Markdown format, produced daily by the Article Engine.

---

## 🧩 Supported Output Targets (Planned)

### 1. **Static Blog Generators**
- Hugo
- Jekyll
- Netlify CMS

### 2. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**
- Notion (via `notion-py`)
- Ghost (via Admin API)

### 3. **Newsletter Services**
- Mailchimp
- Buttondown
- Brevo / Sendinblue

---

## 🔄 Workflow (Concept)

1. Script checks `/articles/` for new `.md` files
2. Option A: Copies the files to a `content/blog/` folder (Hugo/Jekyll)
3. Option B: Pushes the content to a CMS via API
4. Option C: Batches the latest article(s) and sends as email

## ✅ Requirements

- Markdown articles generated by `generate_articles.py`
- Structured filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Optional front matter (YAML or JSON)

Example:

```markdown
---
title: "Critical CVE in Cisco ASA"

# Critical CVE in Cisco ASA
